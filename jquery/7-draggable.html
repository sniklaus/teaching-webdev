			// make jQuery('#draggable') draggable such that you can move it around, just like a window of an application on your computer

			// attach a mousedown listener to jQuery('#draggable') that sets the following global variables: a flag that the element is being dragged, the relative position of the mousedown event
			// you can get the aformentioned relative position within jQuery('#draggable') by using event.pageX / .pageY or jQuery(this).offset().left / .top just like in the listener exercise

			// attach a mousemove listener to the jQuery(document) and keep in mind that due to event bubbling, this event will be fired even if the mouse is on top of jQuery('#draggable')
			// in this mousemove listener, we can update the position of jQuery('#draggable') in case the global is-being-dragged flag is set and we can make it follow the movement of the mouse
			// you can try setting the position of jQuery('#draggable') to event.pageX / .pageY but you eventually have to also incorporate the relative position that we computed in the mousedown event

			// attach a mouseup listener to jQuery(document) that resets the global is-being-dragged flag, such that the dragging will stop once you lift the mouse button
